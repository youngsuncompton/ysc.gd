I’m a graphic designer located in ~~New York~~ ~~Los Angeles~~ Philadelphia with ~15 years of experience making things like websites, identities, ephemera, some exhibitions and books while collaborating with other designers and studios and developers, artists, product managers, small and not-so-small businesses, cultural institutions, start-ups and software companies. I've produced work for Bloomberg, Haworth Furniture, IBM, Mason Gross School of the Arts, MoMA, MoMA Publications, Monotype,  Montclair State University Art Galleries, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, PS1, [Seed Health](https://www.seedhealth.com/){:target="_blank"} (where I most recently lead all things interaction and digital design), and Wildenstein Plattner Institute—a mixed bag.

Back to third person:

YSC was awarded an MFA from the [Maryland Institute College of Art](http://www.micadesign.org/more){:target="_blank"} in 2013 after earning his BFA from [Montclair State University College of the Arts](https://www.montclair.edu/arts/){:target="_blank"} in 2008. He has received recognition from some design publications, and awards from the Type Directors Club, Industrial Designers Society of America, U.S. Cannes, and The Webby Awards.

The typeface used throughout is [Gothic 720](https://www.linotype.com/1084368/gothic-720-family.html){:target="_blank"}. A version of [Venus Grotesk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_(typeface)){:target="_blank"} redrawn for early digital use and initially released by Bitstream. Bitstream created (copied?) a library of "classic" fonts (usually under different names for trademark reasons) in digital form <sup>[src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstream_Inc.){:target="_blank"}</sup>. The capitals are a bit heavier so initials sort of float to the surface—imperfect and charming.

This website was designed and developed by YSC on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"} using [Atom](https://atom.io){:target="_blank"} text editor, and  [iTerm](https://iterm2.com){:target="_blank"}. Running on [Github](https://github.com/youngsuncompton/YSC){:target="_blank"}.
